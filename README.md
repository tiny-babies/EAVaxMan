### Vax-Man in Python with PyGame

### Nicolas Johnson Implementation: For EA's Python task: Pac-Man is now Vax-Man who can kill ghosts (Vaccinate them) on contact.  
Ghosts do not kill Vax Man

Each Ghost multiplies itself by 2 every 30 seconds

The goal of the game is to collect the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 or larger

I took the PacMan game from https://github.com/hbokmann/Pacman to edit.  I gave the ghosts smarter, more efficient, simple, and readable logic for their movement. (When they come into the walls, they will now be smart enough to choose a new direction)
